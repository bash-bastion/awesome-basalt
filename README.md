# Awesome Bash Packages

An awesome list of Bash packages. All packages lists here are compatible with [Basalt](https://github.com/hyperupcall/basalt), a new Bash package manager that is redefining the Bash ecosystem

Keep in mind that everything listed is currently _bleeding edge_; these packages should be expected to have a beta or alpha quality

## General use

- [hyperupcall/woof](https://github.com/hyperupcall/woof) - A generalized version manager (replace pyenv,nvm,n,rvm,rbenv,crenv,phpenv, etc. all at once) (NOT YET RELEASED)
- [hyperupcall/bash-args](https://github.com/hyperupcall/bash-args) - A cute little Bash library for blazing fast argument parsing
- [hyperupcall/bash-object](https://github.com/hyperupcall/bash-object) - The first Bash library for imperatively constructing data of nested and heterogeneous form
- [hyperupcall/bash-toml](https://github.com/hyperupcall/bash-toml) - Bash TOML parser
- [hyperupcall/bats-common-utils](https://github.com/hyperupcall/bats-common-utils) - Aggregation of Bats utility libraries
- [hyperupcall/bash-semver](https://github.com/hyperupcall/bash-semver) - Semantic version library for Bash
- [hyperupcall/template-bash](https://github.com/hyperupcall/template-bash) - A working template of how a Basalt Bash package should work

## Personal use

Because the Basalt ecosystem is so small, I decided to include some packages that I use personally. Of course, they should work on any Linux machine, but documentation and testing is not as extensive as the other repositories listed

- [hyperupcall/glue](https://github.com/hyperupcall/glue) - Hypergeneral boilerplate manager and task runner for projects
- [hyperupcall/choose](https://github.com/hyperupcall/choose) - System for choosing default applications, programs, and utilities
- [hyperupcall/dotshellgen](https://github.com/hyperupcall/dotshellgen) - Dotfile categorization and concatenation
- [hyperupcall/dotshellextract](https://github.com/hyperupcall/dotshellextract) - Extract annotated parts of your shell dotfiles into a separate file
